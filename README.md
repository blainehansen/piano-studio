This was the studio website for blainehansenpiano.com

I've since changed courses in life, and am not teaching anymore, but thought the things I built (especially the teaching resources I created and collected) would still be useful.

The most useful things are those resources, available here:

https://github.com/blainehansen/piano-studio/tree/master/public/resources

and the scores, available here:

https://github.com/blainehansen/piano-studio/tree/master/public/scores

I hope you find this helpful!
