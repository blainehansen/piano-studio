The New Studio Website has finally launched!

Customers and students can now track all of their studio information, keep contact information current, and make payments through the new [user page](/user).

The site is also now a showcase for Blaine's [latest projects](/projects) and [thoughts on music](/blog).

Enjoy!

A [repertoire page](/repertoire) has been added to the teaching area, for students to discover and download pieces they're interested in. The pieces are categorized by difficulty and composer, and include a downloadable score.

Students can use this to choose and download pieces they'd like to play! Expect more additions on an ongoing basis.
